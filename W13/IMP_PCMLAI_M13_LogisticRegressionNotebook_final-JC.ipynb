    "\n",
    "We then look at choosing the best model for classification. For this, we will consider the same variable selection as seen in the first notebook. We will then have a short introduction on regularization. This is a very important concept in Machine Learning, it can be used to avoid over-fitting, as well as for variable selection (which we will not cover). The second set of exercises consists in choosing the best regularization constant, and exploring its effect on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will look at *interpreting* the output of the model to make decisions. We do this by changing the probability thresholds for classification, and explain how we will choose them by considering risk of misclassification."

    "However, we must also consider that the probability threshold of 0.5 might not be optimal. Indeed, consider our current data-set. Let's say we were going to use our model to decide who should go see a doctor and possibly get preventive treatment. In this case, incorrectly predicting that someone will not have Diabetes, when they will, is very costly - the person might face severe health consequences. On the other hand, incorrectly saying someone will have Diabetes, when they won't, is not as bad because the doctor would be able to catch this, and we would just waste a little time. \n",

    "2. Build a new function which takes as inputs: your Logistic Regression model, a set of $X$ values in which to predict, and a probability threshold $T_p$. The function should return an array of predictions based on the new probability threshold. (Hint:  use the $\\texttt{predict\\_proba}$ method in $\\texttt{LogisticRegression}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Investigate the effect of the probability threshold on the number of False Negatives and False Positives. Based on this analysis, what probability threshold would YOU choose? What kind of information would you want to make such a decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "[JC Answer]: At lower thresholds (0.1 to 0.4), we have very few False Negatives (< 30), which means you're capturing most of the positive cases. However, we have a high number of False Positives (>= 10), which indicates that many negative cases are being incorrectly classified as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the threshold increases (0.5 to 0.9), the number of False Positives decreases significantly (<10), which is good because you're reducing the number of negative cases that are incorrectly classified as positive. However, there's an increase in the number of False Negatives(>30), meaning that some positive cases are being missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the medical context, False Negatives might be more costly because failing to identify a sick patient could have serious health consequences. Hence, we need to consult with medical professionals and further cost-benefit analysis is required to decide the threshold. \n"
