# Datasheet



## Motivation

* #### For what purpose was the dataset created?
  The dataset was created for the purpose of online payment fraud detection. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and testing       machine learning models to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.
    
* #### Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?

  Unfortunately, the specific team, research group, or entity responsible for creating this dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the         description, nor are the details about the funding sources provided. However, the license is owned by MIT.

 
## Composition

* #### What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?
  The instances in this dataset represent online payment transactions. Each instance corresponds to a specific payment transaction.
    
* #### How many instances of each type are there?
  The dataset contains multiple instances of payment transactions. There are 101,613 instances in the dataset description.
	
* #### Is there any missing data?
  The dataset must have been pre-processed as there is no missing value in the dataset.
	
* #### Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?*
  There is no indication that the dataset contains confidential information such as legal privilege or doctor–patient confidentiality.  
    

## Collection process

* #### How was the data acquired?
  The dataset’s acquisition process is not detailed in the description.
	
* #### If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
  The dataset description does not specify whether it is a sample from a larger subset.
	
* #### Over what time frame was the data collected?
  The time frame over which the data was collected is not explicitly provided in the dataset description.
    
    
## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

* #### Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 

  The description does not mention specific preprocessing steps. However, it appears that preprocessing or cleaning may have been done prior   to sharing of the dataset in Kaggle.

 
## Uses

* #### What other tasks could the dataset be used for?
    Apart from fraud detection, this dataset could potentially be used for anomaly detection, pattern recognition, or machine learning model     development.
	
* #### Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
  The dataset consumer should be aware of potential biases or fairness issues related to fraud detection. Unfair treatment of individuals or   groups (e.g., stereotyping) should be avoided.

* #### Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
  The dataset should not be used for purposes that could harm individuals or result in legal or financial risks.
    

## Distribution

* #### How has the dataset already been distributed?
  The dataset has been made available on Kaggle, a platform widely used by data scientists and machine learning practitioners for sharing     and accessing datasets. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pankajtiwari2003/fraudlent-transaction
	
* #### Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
  MIT owned the license and no other information provided any terms of use.
    

## Maintenance

* #### Who maintains the dataset?
  Information about the dataset’s maintenance is not explicitly provided. However, Pankaj Tiwari is the owner of this Kaggle page. The last   update was 2 months ago.
